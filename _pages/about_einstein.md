Hi, I am PhD student @ [University of Massachusetts Amherst](https://www.umass.edu/){:target="_blank"}. I work on security policy analysis of large-scale systems with [Dr. Muhammad Taqi Raza](https://people.umass.edu/taqi/){:target="_blank"} in [Khwarizmi Lab](https://khwarizmilab.github.io/){:target="_blank"}.

I study security policies of large-scale (like FinTech, Aviation, etc.) systems for identifying vulnerabilities and mitigating risks like data breaches and unauthorized access. My research focuses on conducting comprehensive and systematic security analyses of modern digital systems. This includes scrutinizing the security functions: authentication, authorization, and access control mechanisms within systems involving millions of users to ensure the highest standard of protection for users and business assets. A systematic analysis of security policies not only enhances the resilience of systems but also ensures compliance with regulations and industry-recommended practices. Therefore, my research paves the way for the development of effective remedies, ensuring the integrity and trustworthiness of digital systems in various operational contexts.

Before joining UMass, I completed my Bachelor's in Computer Science (BSCS) from [National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST)](https://nust.edu.pk/){:target="_blank"}, Pakistan in 2020. At NUST, I worked as a Research Assistant in the [TUKL-NUST R&D Center](https://tukl.seecs.nust.edu.pk/){:target="_blank"}, focusing on document detection, localization, and OCR for information extraction.
