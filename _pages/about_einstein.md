Hi, I am PhD student @ University of Massachusetts Amherst. I work on security policy analysis of large-scale systems with Dr. Muhammad Taqi Raza in [Khwarizmi Lab](https://khwarizmilab.github.io/){:target="_blank"}.
Before joining UMass, I completed my Bachelor's in Computer Science (BSCS) from [National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST)](https://nust.edu.pk/){:target="_blank"}, Pakistan in 2020.

I am studying security policies of large-scale systems for identifying vulnerabilities and mitigating risks like data breaches and unauthorized access. A systematic analysis of security policies not only enhances the resilience of systems but also ensures compliance with regulations and industry-recommended practices. Our research endeavors focus on conducting comprehensive security analyses of modern digital systems. We scrutinize the authentication, authorization, and access control mechanisms within systems involving millions of users —such as banking— to ensure the highest standard of protection for users and business assets. Our findings pave the way for the development of effective remedies, ensuring the integrity and trustworthiness of digital systems in various operational contexts.
