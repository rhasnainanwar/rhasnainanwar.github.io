    description: "The paper investigates security weaknesses in digital wallet payment systems, identifying vulnerabilities due to decentralized authority delegation and excessive trust between banks and wallet apps. The researchers demonstrate how attackers can exploit these issues to add stolen cards, bypass transaction authorization, and violate access control, and propose practical remedies to address these critical design flaws."

    description: "The talk highlights critical vulnerabilities in digital wallet security, emphasizing that banks overly trust wallet apps for authentication and authorization, using wallet IDs instead of verifying the actual cardholder's identity. This trust enables attackers to add stolen cards to wallets and bypass security checks. The proposed solution involves adopting user-centered verification approaches like push-based multi-factor authentication and periodic re-authentication to enhance digital wallet security."
